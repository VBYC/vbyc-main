                                <p>I am proud to be back as your Camp Director in 2016.  Another year of learning in the off season will     lend itself to a well prepared summer staff and more fun and magic for your children!</p>  
                                <p>My favorite things about camp are watching campers during Thought and Campfire, sharing stories or     songs or skits. I love hearing the sounds of children chattering, singing and laughing all around me at any     given time of day. My most favorite thing is watching timid young souls at registration blossom into best     buddies and struggle to say goodbye to their new friends on Saturday mornings. I also love watching     new staff start out a little timid each season and grow into seasoned leaders by summerâ€™s end. The     transformations are sometimes amazing.</p>  
                                <p>My history with VBYC started as a high school student at Leadership in 1980. I was a counselor, program staff member, Head Counselor, Morning Cook, Assistant Director and Director in my first 12 years out here. Since then, I have been mostly in Restaurant Management where my love for learning was encouraged every day. I also have served on the VBYC Board of Directors for most of the 20 years I was away.     I live in Kalamazoo with my kids, my husband Brian, and three cats...soon to add a bunny?   My son, Zak, a freshman at MSU, and daughter Kenzie, a sophomore, at Loy Norrix, have been campers here since they were little.</p>
                                <p>I continue to love what I do. I still learn something new every day.  I love doing that with your campers and my staff.  I love the quiet beauty of VBYC in the spring and the fall and the anticipation of a new season to come.   I am a happy camper!!</p>
