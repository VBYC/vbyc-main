During a recreational camp session, qualified, certified instructors lead organized programs in swimming, canoeing, kayaking, folk dancing, drama, nature exploration, arts and crafts, archery, riflery, sports, and team building.

Every Camp session includes campfire skits and songs and all-camp games like water wars and Capture the Flag. Each camp session provides time for campers to plan activities together, take polar-bear swims and participate in Evening Rec every night. All of these activities and classes promote opportunities for making friends, sharing, and laughing all the while having a fun-filled camp week."

During a recreational camp session, qualified, certified instructors lead organized programs in swimming, canoeing, kayaking, folk dancing, drama, nature exploration, arts and crafts, archery, riflery, sports, and team building.

Every Camp session includes campfire skits and songs and all-camp games like water wars and Capture the Flag. Each camp session provides time for campers to plan activities together, take polar-bear swims and participate in Evening Rec every night. All of these activities and classes promote opportunities for making friends, sharing, and laughing all the while having a fun-filled camp week."
