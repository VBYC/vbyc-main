Campers build self-confidence, positive relationships, personal integrity and individual and group responsibility. VBYC is all about leadership, fellowship, creativity and fun!

VBYC is a residential, co-ed camp on the shores of Great Bear Lake, and nestled in western Michigan's fruit belt, VBYC is home to rolling hills, endless trees, rustic cabins, and <a href=\"http://www.vbyc.org/facilities/\">varied recreation and communal areas</a>.

We welcome all campers, ages six to eighteen, without regard to gender, race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious, economic, or cultural background.

Camp exists outside of social divisions and cultural expectations. Removed from our everyday lives, we are free to transcend cliques and create our own culture, one of games, skits, projects, songs, kissing Cleo the Moose, teamwork and community service.

VBYC is a place where all children can be themselves - free to be who they are, free to discover their innate talents, free to explore, grow and learn. Campers can try new things in a safe, supportive and caring atmosphere.

Friendships and memories made at Camp last forever. Regardless of the careers our Alumni choose; they provide quiet leadership and positive role models for others each and every day. They embody the ideals and values learned at VBYC when becoming positive, contributing, involved members of their communities. And that keeps the Spirit of Camp alive throughout the generations.

Come join us for what promises to be a wonderful, fun-filled, life-changing experience!

<h3>Classes</h3>
These are the traditional activities we think of when we think of summer camp: archery, swimming, arts and crafts etc. Campers attend classes each day with their cabin group, and have the chance to try every class by the end of the week. <a href=\"/camp-life/classes/\">See full class list.</a>
<h3>Free Time</h3>
Campers choose from a variety of offerings led by the staff, from games like Four-Square, roof ball, and frisbee golf, from traditional sports like soccer and basketball, to telling stories, creating skits, flying kites, and scavenger hunts. When the store is open campers may buy treats and souvenirs.

There is always time in between activities to allow campers to relax and hang out. Sometimes these moments of relaxation spark new friendships and make lasting memories.
<h3>Traditions</h3>
Camp is full of traditions that brings campers back every summer. Here are a few:
<ul>
	<li class=\"item\"><strong>Special Day.</strong> A day-long participatory skit during which the campers help the visiting heroes save Camp from villains, who often want to turn camp into a parking lot. These are epic. Alumni remember Special Days for decades.</li>
	<li class=\"item\"><strong>Camp Songs.</strong> Camp has a song for every situation!</li>
	<li class=\"item\"><strong>Kissing the Moose.</strong> Don't get caught eating with your elbows on the table!</li>
	<li class=\"item\"><strong>Honor Cabin.</strong> Campers earn tokens for their cabin by doing all manner of silly things.</li>
	<li class=\"item\"><strong>Jumping in the Lake.</strong> Receive five pieces of mail and you have to (get to!) jump in the lake!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Greetings Camper Families!!!</h4>
I am proud to be back as your Camp Director in 2016. Another year of learning in the off season will lend itself to a well prepared summer staff and more fun and magic for your children!

My favorite things about camp are watching campers during Thought and Campfire, sharing stories or songs or skits. I love hearing the sounds of children chattering, singing and laughing all around me at any given time of day. My most favorite thing is watching timid young souls at registration blossom into best buddies and struggle to say goodbye to their new friends on Saturday mornings. I also love watching new staff start out a little timid each season and grow into seasoned leaders by summer’s end. The transformations are sometimes amazing.

My history with VBYC started as a high school student at Leadership in 1980. I was a counselor, program staff member, Head Counselor, Morning Cook, Assistant Director and Director in my first 12 years out here. Since then, I have been mostly in Restaurant Management where my love for learning was encouraged every day. I also have served on the VBYC Board of Directors for most of the 20 years I was away. I live in Kalamazoo with my kids, my husband Brian, and three cats...soon to add a bunny? My son, Zak, a freshman at MSU, and daughter Kenzie, a sophomore, at Loy Norrix, have been campers here since they were little.

I continue to love what I do. I still learn something new every day. I love doing that with your campers and my staff. I love the quiet beauty of VBYC in the spring and the fall and the anticipation of a new season to come. I am a happy camper!!","Meet The Director","","publish","closed","closed","","meet-the-director","","","2016-04-10 14:30:58","2016-04-10 14:30:58","",0,"http://vbyc:8888/?page_id=56",0,"page","",0

Being ourselves, together.

Since 1950, Van Buren Youth Camp has helped young people discover themselves, grow as individuals and develop leadership skills. Campers build self-confidence, positive relationships, personal integrity and individual and group responsibility. VBYC is all about leadership, fellowship, creativity and fun!

VBYC is a residential, co-ed camp on the shores of Great Bear Lake, and nestled in western Michigan's fruit belt, VBYC is home to rolling hills, endless trees, rustic cabins, and <a href=\"http://www.vbyc.org/facilities/\">varied recreation and communal areas</a>.

We welcome all campers, ages six to eighteen, without regard to gender, race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious, economic, or cultural background.

Camp exists outside of social divisions and cultural expectations. Removed from our everyday lives, we are free to transcend cliques and create our own culture, one of games, skits, projects, songs, kissing Cleo the Moose, teamwork and community service.

VBYC is a place where all children can be themselves - free to be who they are, free to discover their innate talents, free to explore, grow and learn. Campers can try new things in a safe, supportive and caring atmosphere.

Friendships and memories made at Camp last forever. Regardless of the careers our Alumni choose; they provide quiet leadership and positive role models for others each and every day. They embody the ideals and values learned at VBYC when becoming positive, contributing, involved members of their communities. And that keeps the Spirit of Camp alive throughout the generations.

Friendships and memories made at Camp last forever. Regardless of the careers our Alumni choose; they provide quiet leadership and positive role models for others each and every day.

Campers build self-confidence, positive relationships, personal integrity and individual and group responsibility. VBYC is all about leadership, fellowship, creativity and fun!

VBYC is a residential, co-ed camp on the shores of Great Bear Lake, and nestled in western Michigan's fruit belt, VBYC is home to rolling hills, endless trees, rustic cabins, and <a href=\"http://www.vbyc.org/facilities/\">varied recreation and communal areas</a>.

We welcome all campers, ages six to eighteen, without regard to gender, race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious, economic, or cultural background.

Camp exists outside of social divisions and cultural expectations. Removed from our everyday lives, we are free to transcend cliques and create our own culture, one of games, skits, projects, songs, kissing Cleo the Moose, teamwork and community service.

VBYC is a place where all children can be themselves - free to be who they are, free to discover their innate talents, free to explore, grow and learn. Campers can try new things in a safe, supportive and caring atmosphere.

Friendships and memories made at Camp last forever. Regardless of the careers our Alumni choose; they provide quiet leadership and positive role models for others each and every day. They embody the ideals and values learned at VBYC when becoming positive, contributing, involved members of their communities. And that keeps the Spirit of Camp alive throughout the generations.

Campers build self-confidence, positive relationships, personal integrity and individual and group responsibility. VBYC is all about leadership, fellowship, creativity and fun!

VBYC is a residential, co-ed camp on the shores of Great Bear Lake, and nestled in western Michigan's fruit belt, VBYC is home to rolling hills, endless trees, rustic cabins, and <a href=\"http://www.vbyc.org/facilities/\">varied recreation and communal areas</a>.

We welcome all campers, ages six to eighteen, without regard to gender, race, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious, economic, or cultural background.

Camp exists outside of social divisions and cultural expectations. Removed from our everyday lives, we are free to transcend cliques and create our own culture, one of games, skits, projects, songs, kissing Cleo the Moose, teamwork and community service.

VBYC is a place where all children can be themselves - free to be who they are, free to discover their innate talents, free to explore, grow and learn. Campers can try new things in a safe, supportive and caring atmosphere.

Friendships and memories made at Camp last forever. Regardless of the careers our Alumni choose; they provide quiet leadership and positive role models for others each and every day. They embody the ideals and values learned at VBYC when becoming positive, contributing, involved members of their communities. And that keeps the Spirit of Camp alive throughout the generations.

Come join us for what promises to be a wonderful, fun-filled, life-changing experience!

<h4>Greetings Camper Families!!!</h4>
I am proud to be back as your Camp Director in 2016. Another year of learning in the off season will lend itself to a well prepared summer staff and more fun and magic for your children!

My favorite things about camp are watching campers during Thought and Campfire, sharing stories or songs or skits. I love hearing the sounds of children chattering, singing and laughing all around me at any given time of day. My most favorite thing is watching timid young souls at registration blossom into best buddies and struggle to say goodbye to their new friends on Saturday mornings. I also love watching new staff start out a little timid each season and grow into seasoned leaders by summer’s end. The transformations are sometimes amazing.

My history with VBYC started as a high school student at Leadership in 1980. I was a counselor, program staff member, Head Counselor, Morning Cook, Assistant Director and Director in my first 12 years out here. Since then, I have been mostly in Restaurant Management where my love for learning was encouraged every day. I also have served on the VBYC Board of Directors for most of the 20 years I was away. I live in Kalamazoo with my kids, my husband Brian, and three cats...soon to add a bunny? My son, Zak, a freshman at MSU, and daughter Kenzie, a sophomore, at Loy Norrix, have been campers here since they were little.

I continue to love what I do. I still learn something new every day. I love doing that with your campers and my staff. I love the quiet beauty of VBYC in the spring and the fall and the anticipation of a new season to come. I am a happy camper!!","Meet The Director","","inherit","closed","closed","","56-revision-v1","","","2016-04-04 13:02:07","2016-04-04 13:02:07","",56,"http://vbyc:8888/2016/04/04/56-revision-v1/",0,"revision","",0
