                                        <p>Our archery range is on land close to the main Camp. Campers learn proper archery safety and terminology, then develop accuracy when shooting at targets attached to a haywall. Archery is often a favorite class. Campers who strike a bull’s-eye or accomplish other noteworthy achievements become members of the famed VBYC Archery Club, one of our esteemed Camp traditions.

                                        <p>The Arts and Crafts program allows campers to use their imaginations with simple,, easy-to-find materials as well as materials found in nature. The classes are held atop a hill that is one of the highest points of VBYC  allowing a great breeze from the lake to flow through the building. It provides a relaxing, pleasant atmosphere for campers to enjoy chatting with friends as creativity flows helping to create simple fun projects.  Campers are given project guidelines but are also allowed to make their own creative project during the class period.</p>

                                        <p>The Canoeing &amp; Kayaking classes begin with a 15 - 20 minute  instruction period, Campers learn basic canoeing/kayaking strokes: steering their vessel, working with their partner, keeping the boat level and stable, all with an emphasis on safety. Then, if ready, campers take to  the lake boating as a group, floating near cattails, onto the sandbar, all the way to the creek, or out into the middle of the lake. Canoeing and kayaking are always Camp favorites.</p>

                                        <p>Campers must be at least a "B" (moderate-level) swimmer to participate. If a camper doesn’t qualify they may choose another class for that period. Canoes &amp; Kayaks are always in visual contact of the waterfront director, who is on shore, available, and can be signaled through whistles. VBYC uses one rescue motorboat and a rescue rowboat for emergencies.

                                        <p>This class is an opportunity for cabins to use group problem solving through cooperation, and can really bring campers together. As with all VBYC classes, safety is the first priority. This course can be both physically challenging and a test of will. The challenges are not intended to be solved by individuals. Instead it is necessary for campers to rely on one another to successfully complete each challenge. Campers often surprise themselves when they complete this course.</p>
                                        <p>At the beginning of the class, campers learn a series of "calls" and procedures. During the class campers learn about obstacles including blocks of wood, imaginary rivers to cross, a 10' climbing wall, a grid of climbing rope, suspended cable walk (4' high), and many other obstacles</p>

                                        <p>Riflery focuses primarily on gun safety. Our rifle range is located on acreage just up the road but separate from main Camp. Many camps no longer teach this course. VBYC chooses to keep riflery because it provides  campers the opportunity to promote the seriousness of the safe use of guns.
</p>
                                        <p>Campers shoot from a covered pavilion with a wooden floor, and use .22-caliber rifles to shoot at bull’s-eye targets that hang from a sand mound. The campers are approximately 25 ft. from the target and are not allowed to step off of the covered pavilion. 

                                        </p>
                                        <p>Some campers are not comfortable shooting a rifle, which is fine, as they still learn much about gun safety. That said we find that most campers think riflery  is an awesome class. </p>
